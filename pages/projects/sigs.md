METRO is proud to support the work of our members through Special Interest Groups. Each group is convened by leaders in our field around a topic of interest to our wider community.
We currently host the following groups:

The Bibliographic Instruction Special Interest Group (SIG) is composed of individuals interested in various aspects of library instruction. Meetings throughout the year cover a wide range of instruction topics and offer important opportunities for networking and information sharing. The SIG also provides professional development opportunities through group discussion, and presentations by group members, vendors and others. Topics targeted for future meetings include instruction for targeted groups, distance learning and bibliographic instruction, developing assessment tools, and planning for the future needs of bibliographic instruction.

The High School to College Transition SIG provides an opportunity for high school and college librarians to share their experiences. The group will help high school librarians prepare students for college. Academic librarians will gain a better idea of where students are coming from and how they can help. 

Through conversation, this SIG will work to ease students’ transition between high school and college. Topics of discussion and presentations include college readiness, the first year college experience, and enhancing critical thinking. Librarians from public and independent schools, college, and universities, as well as support staff, are welcome.

##myMETRO SIG## 

Karen Erani and Helen Tannenbaum, Conveners

The myMETRO membership is extraordinarily diverse in professional experiences and backgrounds. We hope this SIG will provide a forum for us to share experiences and discuss career opportunities or find out "how others did it" and maybe lead us to think about jobs we would not have considered before. 


##OPEN SIG##  
[https://sites.google.com/a/metro.org/opensig/](https://sites.google.com/a/metro.org/opensig/)

Kathy Shaughnessy and Gina Robinson, Conveners

Libraries are often the only place that patrons can get access to important proprietary software and resources; however, lifelong information and technology literacy entails being able to apply “library-acquired skills” across work, home, educational, recreational, and civic environments, within ever-changing budget constraints. This SIG welcomes all librarians and information professionals who would like to find/use/share Free & Open Source Software (FOSS) and Open Access (OA) resources, and who are interested in promoting an “open“ resource ecology. 


##Outreach and Advocacy##

The Outreach and Advocacy SIG discusses innovative methods to advocate for programs, services, and staff. Topics of discussion include developing outreach goals, establishing your library's identity, creating a successful library campaign from start to finish, lemonading a library disaster into something positive, developing assessment tools to conduct community analysis, building partnership, and crafting visual materials. 


##Pop Culture SIG## 
[https://sites.google.com/a/metro.org/pop-culture-sig/](https://sites.google.com/a/metro.org/pop-culture-sig/)

Caroline Fuchs and Michael Handis, Conveners

To best serve today's patrons, librarians need a broad understanding of the wide spectrum of the arts and popular culture that are of interest to our users. From gaming to comics to cosplay to streaming video, librarians are becoming both advocates of and experts in these non-traditional collections. The Pop Culture SIG aims to engage librarians in a dialogue on the wide range of cultural productions and practices that are redefining library collections and the resulting changes in practice in librarianship. We welcome librarians from all types of libraries to join the discussion.

Melissa Morrone and Cynthia Tobar, Conveners

The Social Justice Special Interest Group welcomes all librarians, archivists, and other information professionals who are interested in activities on community-centered activism, social movements, and outreach. Through meetings, presentations, discussion groups, and other events, we will reflect on and rethink the intersections of libraries and archives with social justice struggles. Some questions we will explore include: How do the ways we preserve, analyze, document and mobilize our collections, instruction, and services connect with the work of community activists in their fights for racial, economic, and gender justice? What does it mean to have a commitment to social justice in our profession and practice? How does librarianship embrace, challenge, or hinder various forms of access to information, documentation, and archives? 


##User Experience (UX)##
