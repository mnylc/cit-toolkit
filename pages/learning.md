## Events ## 

METRO hosts a diverse range of events that give our
members a platform to explore and discuss relevant and meaningful
topics, technologies, and trends. More information on our upcoming
event schedule is available
[here.]( {{ '/events/' | prepend: site.baseurl }} )

## Lynda.com ##

lynda.com is a leading online learning company that helps anyone learn business, software, technology and creative skills to achieve personal and professional goals. We provide our members free access to lynda.com online training in eight week increments.  During that access period, you will have free reign to take all lynda.com courses. Certificates of completion are available for courses you watch in their entirety.  After eight weeks, your license will be inactivated and made available to the next member, but your user profile will be saved. If you like, you may then request renewed 8-week access at a later date.

## Special Interest Groups ##

The library community encompasses a vast spectrum of interests, specializations, and disciplines. To support the interests of our members, METRO hosts an array of Special Interest Groups (SIGs). SIGs are open to staff from METRO member libraries, myMETRO members, and other interested individuals. SIG meetings are open to the public, and members interested in any particular SIG are welcome to join the SIG's discussion list.

Our 19 SIGs cover a variety of topics. Read more about each group [here.]( {{ '/projects/sigs/' | prepend: site.baseurl }} )
